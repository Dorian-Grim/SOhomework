# SOhomework

This project was made during my studies at UTM Informatics, year I, semester 1, with the help of two colleagues (more or less two, at little bit more over to one). For the Operating System course. It represents a summary of commands from this book, put into a terminal menu for the user to interact with.

You can see all commits by opening the scripts folder.
